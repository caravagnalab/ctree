Title: ctree - Clone Tree
Type: Package
Author: Giulio Caravagna
Maintainer: Giulio Caravagna <gcaravagn@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides an implementation for clone trees
  that can be build of Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) clusters computed by
  tumour subclonal deconvolution. This type of models can be used to study
  the evolutionary trajectories of a tumour from bulk sequencing data.
  This package provides several functions to generate clone trees from 
  the results of subclonal deconvolution analyses, to plot and summarise
  trees, and is part of the `evoverse`, a package that gathers multiple R
  packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
